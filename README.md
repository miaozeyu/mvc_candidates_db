# mvc_candidates_db
This is a MVC project that simulates a Headhunter's database. It uses Flask as the web framework, SQLAlchmey as ORM and Jinja for frontend. By doing this project, my goal is to practice Object Oriented Programming using my favorite language - Python as well as learning a web framework and ORM.
